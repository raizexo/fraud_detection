# fraud_detection

This analysis is based upon the kaggle competition dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1).

This Jupyter Notebook will cover the most of the explanation of the simple analysis and model development of the dataset.

## Installation
Working with this notebook will require you to have [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or you can simply run this file on Google Colab. There are also other ways to work on a jupyter notebook but i will not cover them here as these two are the most simple ways to work on a jupyter notebook.
You will also need to download the dataset to work with so please click here to download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1).
